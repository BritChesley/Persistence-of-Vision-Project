# Persistence-of-Vision-Project
Project for Senior Design Fall 2019
The VS folder has the code for transmitting images and animations to the microcontroller via an FTDI chip. The main file here is "newGIF.cpp"
The "Code Composer" folder is where the Ti DSP chip was programmed from (many files removed, just the main .c files included".
  The header and source files for certain peripherals were separeted into the "inc" and "src" files.
